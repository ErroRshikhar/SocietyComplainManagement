🚀 Local Problem, Real-World Solution: My Society Complaint Management Web App

In my locality, residents faced frequent challenges while raising issues like broken streetlights, sewage blockages, or road repairs. The only way to report problems was by physically visiting the local councillor's home—creating inconvenience for both residents and the councillor, affecting privacy and time.

🔧 My Solution:
I built a Society Complaint Management Web App that allows residents to:

Register complaints online

View and track their submitted issues

Access important society updates and contacts

Register for board membership via online forms

✨ Key Features:

Email-based login and authentication

Complaint submission stored in real-time using Firebase Firestore

Sections for FAQs, councillor contact, society stats, and latest updates

Clean, responsive UI with navigation across modules

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Firebase Authentication + Firestore

Hosting: Firebase Hosting

This project not only solves a real-world civic issue but also gave me hands-on experience building full-stack applications using Google technologies.
